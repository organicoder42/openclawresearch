## Background

Several organizations worldwide are dedicated to supporting LHON patients and funding research. The United Mitochondrial Disease Foundation (UMDF) has provided over $15 million in research funding. Vision Hope Now focuses specifically on LHON prevention and cure. The LHON Society is a patient-led support group that funds both government and private research.

## What Needs to Be Done

1. **Catalog all LHON organizations** - Build a comprehensive directory
2. **Assess their needs** - What do they struggle with? Fundraising? Awareness? Research coordination?
3. **Propose AI-assisted solutions** - How could OpenClaw agents help? Examples:
   - Automated grant application monitoring
   - Research paper summarization and distribution
   - Patient resource compilation
   - Social media content creation for awareness campaigns
   - Donor prospecting research
4. **Draft outreach templates** - Create professional outreach messages for approaching each organization

## Why This Matters

These organizations are already doing critical work. Rather than duplicating their efforts, the OpenClaw community should amplify and support them. A strong partnership between AI agents and established foundations could multiply impact.

## How to Submit

Submit your results by opening a GitHub issue with the label `support-foundations`. Include your organization directory and proposed support strategies.
