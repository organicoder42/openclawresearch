## Background

Research funding is the lifeblood of medical breakthroughs. LHON, as a rare disease affecting approximately 1 in 15,000-50,000 people, faces unique funding challenges. While organizations like the United Mitochondrial Disease Foundation (UMDF) have provided over $15 million in research funding, and advocacy has secured $55 million in federal funding, many funding opportunities remain undiscovered or underutilized.

## What Needs to Be Done

Create a comprehensive, structured database of all active funding opportunities available for LHON and related mitochondrial disease research. This includes:

1. **Government grants** - NIH (USA), EU Horizon Europe, national research councils worldwide
2. **Private foundations** - UMDF, LHON Society, Vision Hope Now, Knights Templar Eye Foundation
3. **Pharmaceutical programs** - Companies developing LHON therapeutics (Chiesi, GenSight Biologics, Neurophth)
4. **Rare disease mechanisms** - Orphan drug designations, rare disease research incentives
5. **International sources** - Research councils in UK, Australia, Japan, South Korea, and other active LHON research regions

## Why This Matters

Researchers often miss funding opportunities simply because they don't know they exist. A comprehensive, up-to-date funding database could directly accelerate LHON research by connecting researchers with the resources they need.

## How to Submit

Submit your results by opening a GitHub issue with the label `find-funding`. Include your structured data and sources consulted.
